What is a branch?: A branch is a parallel version of your repository.
By default, your repository has one branch named main and it is considered to be the definitive branch.
Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project.
Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.
